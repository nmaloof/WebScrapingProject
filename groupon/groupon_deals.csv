Use our guide to make the most of your upcoming session.,A massage can already be a vulnerable experience, so the question of how much pressure the therapist should apply can be tough to answer, especially given that everyone experiences pressure differently. Fortunately, there are basically three possible responses—light, medium, or firm—and considering the following factors may help you decide:,Pain Tolerance:,If you find yourself extremely sensitive to touch, request light pressure. Likewise, people who can tolerate rigorous—possibly even uncomfortable—pressure should choose firm to get the most out of the muscle manipulation. Always trust your body; if firm pressure feels too intense, ask the therapist to ease up.,Why Are You Here?:,If your top priority is relaxation, then light or medium pressure is for you. If you want to work out knots, relieve concentrated tension, or pop the balloon animal you swallowed, then firm pressure may be required. If you’re looking for a mix of outcomes, explain them in detail, pointing out specific areas and desired results. For instance, you might say, “I want to loosen my back muscles but break up knots in my shoulders,” each of which requires a different amount of pressure.,Don’t Sweat It:,Massage therapy is designed to improve the body’s overall function, whether by promoting relaxation or relieving aches and pains. So even if you choose a pressure level at the start of a massage, you’re not locked into it—you can request lighter or firmer pressure at any point during treatment. Good massage therapists appreciate and respond to feedback, which helps them develop personalized sessions that feel good and fulfill your expectations.",Stellar Fitness Spa,"Limited Time Remaining!,Up to 61% Off,6 Ratings",Full-Body Massage or Reflexology at Stellar Fitness Spa (Up to 61% Off).

Read on for a basic overview of this stubborn foe.,Follicle,: the part of the skin that anchors an individual shaft of hair. Each follicle consists of a sebaceous gland, which secretes oil (sebum) to condition the hair and skin, and a few nerve endings at the base that allow hair to carry out one of its main functions: to act as a sensitive touch receptor.,Growth cycles,: during the initial phase of the hair-growth cycle,,anagen,, strands grow up to 0.2 mm per day. This is followed by a,catagen,phase, which lasts two–three weeks, then a,telogen,phase in which hair stops growing. Individual follicles may be at different stages of the cycle at any given time.,Epilation,: the removal of hair from the root. Common methods include tweezing, waxing, laser hair removal, and stapling a tiny eviction notice to every follicle.,Depilation,: the removal of hair from above the skin, usually via shaving or depilation creams, which evolved in the 1930s from formulas used to remove hair from cattle hides.,Jazz bikinis,: the common term for the short skirts worn by flappers in the 1920s—a trend often attributed to the rise of leg shaving as a popular routine.",Excellent Brows,"Limited Time Remaining!,Up to 56% Off,4 Ratings",One or Three Brazilian Sugaring Waxes at Excellent Brows (Up to 56% Off),Midtown Manhattan,New York,4 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/excellent-brows

 lash extensions create a lush look. Learn what to expect with Groupon’s
 exploration of these eyelash impostors.,The first modern false 
eyelashes were made from human hair, commissioned by silent-film 
director D. W. Griffith so that his starlet’s lashes would touch her 
cheeks with every soulful downward gaze. Although you may think it’d be 
hard to improve on these natural materials, in reality, the difference 
in texture between eyelashes and the stuff that grows from the head 
would make such extensions look a little strange. Stick-on strips have 
been available in drugstores for decades, but it wasn’t until the 
mid-2000s that cosmetic scientists developed semipermanent extensions. 
Also known as grafted lashes, these delicate fibers fuse to the top of 
pre-existing lashes with pharmaceutical-grade glue, lending eyes a lush,
 natural-looking fringe without the use of mascara.,As clients 
lie on a table with their eyes shut, a professional applies artificial 
lashes strand by strand, carefully bonding them about a millimeter away 
from the eyelid to avoid any contact with the skin or eye. The look 
stays intact for about two to six weeks—natural eyelashes have a finite 
lifespan, and when they fall out, they take the extensions with them.,Lash
 extensions generally come in two varieties: mink and synthetic. Mink 
extensions are made from sanitized, hypoallergenic hairs collected by 
brushing live mink, the same petite carnivores whose famously soft fur 
is prized for a variety of other applications. For synthetic extensions,
 lab technicians replicate the look and feel of natural hairs by forging
 lashes from plastic, faux-mink poly fibers, silk blends, or 
high-quality keraspecific fibers, which are chemically identical to real
 human hair. No matter the material, extensions should feel comfortable 
and light as they frame what poets have long called “the windows to the 
soul” and “the worst part of the face to be poked in.”",Curvy Lashes,"Limited Time Remaining!,Up to 57% Off,33 Ratings",Eyelash Extensions at Curvy Lashes (Up to 57% Off). Two Options Available.,Midtown Manhattan,New York,33 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/curvy-lashes

Before entering the salon, however, a client has to decide how much of the hair to highlight. Applied evenly throughout the entire head, full highlights create a natural look that mimics the way hair changes color over time in the sun, adding a sense of dimension and texture to the existing hair. Partial highlights, which are typically cheaper and take less time to apply, serve an altogether different purpose: drawing attention to specific features, such as bangs or newly sharpened antlers, by accenting only the locks on the surface. As a result, partial highlights are somewhat less flexible—losing their effect, for example, when putting your hair up or teasing it out.",Farah Salon & Spa Inc.,"Limited Time Remaining!,20+ viewed today,137 Ratings",Haircut Package with Optional Color or Partial Highlights at Farah Salon & Spa (Up to 68% Off),West Village,New York,137 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/farah-salon-spa-inc

Under dry conditions, the tiny scales that cover its surface become raised and brittle, causing hairs to tangle and lose their shine. Conditioner aims to correct this problem by bonding a particular class of molecules, called cationic surfactants, to the cuticle. This is possible because keratin, the protein that makes up most of the hair shaft, bristles with negative ions, which attract the positively charged surfactants, coating each thread in a thin film that weighs it down and reduces frizz. (The negative charge of keratin is also what causes static whenever positive ions are stripped from the hair—the static that makes it possible to stick a balloon to the wall or to power a miner’s headlamp.),The other ingredients in conditioner don’t always need ions to do their jobs well. Humectants suck in water from the surrounding air, thereby moisturizing the hair, and oils simply penetrate the cuticle. Glossers coat the hair with light-reflecting polymers, increasing shine, whereas other ingredients raise the acidity level of the conditioner, which helps protect the hair’s protein structure.",Evolve Salon,"Limited Time Remaining!,100+ viewed today,171 Ratings","One Haircut, Deep Conditioning, and Blow-Dry or Highlights, Ombre, or Balayage at Evolve Salon (Up to 68% Off)",Evolve Salon,New York,171 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/evolve-salon-4

Learn how this works with Groupon’s look into microcurrent therapy.,If the idea of sending electricity into your face seems a little alarming, don’t worry: the currents used to stimulate the skin and muscles during microcurrent therapy pack only one-millionth of the power needed to illuminate a light bulb. What’s more, they’re just adding to the tiny electrical signals running through your body at all times—which is part of the reason they’re used in medicine in the first place. Medical researchers have long noticed that when tissue is injured, the currents that normally run through it tend to be diminished. Physical therapists have accordingly found that electrically stimulating the injured area can help wounds and conditions such as tennis elbow or soccer head heal faster.,Whether these restorative effects extend to improving the condition of healthy tissue isn’t yet clear. Skincare specialists use microcurrent treatments in two different ways: to stimulate the skin and facial muscles for a more toned appearance, and to help water-based products penetrate the skin more effectively. The second application also has a long medical lineage, and consists of using an electrode to drive a water-based serum—which has an existing ionic charge—away from itself and thus into the skin.,The treatment often described as a “nonsurgical face-lift” is meant to make lasting (though not permanent) changes to muscle tone and to increase collagen and elastin production. So far, few studies have been done to assess these effects, possibly because scientists want to keep all the best beauty tips for themselves. But it’s likely that, no matter what, you’ll notice at least some short-term changes. Microcurrent treatments do a great job of stimulating blood flow, so clients tend to leave the spa with a rosier, plumper, and—given the relaxing effects of an ordinary facial—serener complexion.",Self Empowered Minds,"Limited Time Remaining!,Up to 80% Off,53 Ratings",60-Minute Microcurrent Skin Treatment with Optional Hair Follicle Test at Self Empowered Minds (Up to 80% Off),Multiple Locations,New York,53 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/self-empowered-minds-3

Check out Groupon’s guide to help you tell the stylist how you want to look.,Beyond keeping hair out of your eyes or providing easy access to your brain’s escape hatch, the way you part your hair can reflect how the world perceives you—and how you perceive yourself. How to part it depends largely on the shape of your face. Here are a few basic guidelines to finding the right method:,Heart:,With their wider cheekbones and glowing foreheads, heart-shaped faces radiate with either a side or diagonal part. However, if you have longer hair, a middle part may help to balance out your prominent cheeks.,Square:,The trick with a square-shaped face is to soften its features. A deep-side part or diagonal part allows hair to fall gently over any sharp angles, rounding them out. In this case, it’s best to begin the part right above the arch of one eyebrow.,Circle:,A slightly diagonal part that stretches from the middle of the forehead to the back of the hair lends a dramatic curtain effect to circle-shaped faces, enhancing and elongating the features on the side with the greater exposure.,Oval:,Oval-shaped faces have it toughest of all, since they’re doomed to be able to pull off any look they want. The choices are virtually infinite. Part it down the middle or down either side. Don’t part it at all. Part it six times—the world is your oyster cracker. However, many stylists would recommend a middle part, since side parts already suit the shapes above.,The decision of,where,to part the hair, however, isn’t completely cosmetic. Some people theorize, for example, that a left part indicates someone with strong leadership skills. This theory earned some cred during the 2000 US presidential election, when left-parting George W. Bush defeated right-parting Al Gore. Even comic books lend it some credence, as the unassuming Clark Kent switches his part from the right to the left when he becomes the all-powerful Superman. Still, it could be just a coincidence—many successful leaders part their hair on the right or not at all, and either way, the decision is not always up for debate; a cowlick, for instance, is nearly impossible to tame, often forcing you to adapt your style to suit it.,Whichever part you choose, heed these words: even if the person you see in the mirror seems meek, the world may still see you as powerful. As posited in an,episode,of NPR’s Radiolab, humans tend to favor the version of themselves they see in the mirror, but others will always see them as the opposite image. Our perception of ourselves is inherently flawed. Therefore, if you like the way your hair looks parted to the left, you may want to actually part it to the,right,, even—and perhaps especially—if it looks strange in the mirror.",Lovella NYC,"Limited Time Remaining!,Up to 67% Off,1 Ratings",Hairstyling Services at Lovella NYC (Up to 67% Off).

Check out Groupon’s guide to the body’s pliable armor.,If you were to take all your skin and spread it out, it would, on average, cover a twin bed. And though that might be a blessing when you’ve run out of clean sheets, it would leave you defenseless against hazards such as bacteria, chemicals, sunlight, and even water. A complex system of more than 300 million constantly regenerating cells, nerves, and glands, the skin is not only the body’s largest organ, but also its first line of defense against the environment, a flexible, waterproof sheath for all the muscles, bones, and sensitive electronics inside.,In most cases, we can only see the skin’s outer layer, or epidermis, but two more layers lie just below the surface—the dermis, full of flexible collagen and elastin, and a subcutaneous layer of fat meant to cushion and insulate our insides. Of the three layers, the dermis is the workhorse, bracing the capillaries that regulate our body temperature and hosting millions of follicles that knit new hair and expel softening oils. But despite its importance, nobody will ever tell you how nice your dermis looks. Beauty, after all, is only epidermis deep, and it’s there where we see the most change. New skin cells are constantly replacing the old, pushing off roughly 1.5 pounds of dead cells every year, and over time the epidermis slowly loses its ability to retain moisture or spring back into place, resulting in wrinkles, dryness, and other signs of wisdom gained.,One of skin’s most useful attributes is its regenerative ability. When the skin breaks or needs repair, the blood vessels amp into overdrive, carrying much-needed nutrients straight to the site on pallets of platelets. This is why a cut forms a scab and, oddly enough, why our face turns red when we’re sunburned; the color isn’t actually a burn—it’s blood rushing to the face to repair the cellular damage caused by UV rays.",Heena's Threading Salon,"Limited Time Remaining!,Up to 58% Off,29 Ratings",One or Two 60-Minute Relaxing Herbal Facials at Heena's Threading Salon (Up to 58% Off),Midtown East,New York,29 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/heena-s-threading-salon-2

Read on for a basic overview of this stubborn foe.,Follicle,: the part of the skin that anchors an individual shaft of hair.

Individual follicles may be at different stages of the cycle at any given time.,Epilation,: the removal of hair from the root. Common methods include tweezing, waxing, laser hair removal, and stapling a tiny eviction notice to every follicle.,Depilation,: the removal of hair from above the skin, usually via shaving or depilation creams, which evolved in the 1930s from formulas used to remove hair from cattle hides.,Jazz bikinis,: the common term for the short skirts worn by flappers in the 1920s—a trend often attributed to the rise of leg shaving as a popular routine.",My After Glow Waxing and Spa,"Limited Time Remaining!,Up to 50% Off,55 Ratings",$25 for One Tea Tree Brazilian Bikini Wax at My After Glow Waxing and Spa ($50 Value),Midtown Manhattan,New York,55 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/my-after-glow-waxing-and-spa-inc-4

Read on to learn more about how a beam of light results in smooth skin.,Laser hair-removal treatments eliminate unwanted hair using a focused beam of light at a fixed wavelength. This light naturally targets a type of pigment known as melanin—the same chemical responsible for skin tanning—within the hair follicles, heating the follicles that are in their active growth phase to discourage future hairs from sprouting. Because the melanin absorbs the focused light, IPL treatments can eliminate hair while having little impact and causing only limited irritation to surrounding skin cells. However, this basic principle also limits the conditions in which IPL treatments can be effective. Those with darker skin and fairer hair, for instance, may require extra sessions, and gray hairs—that is, hairs that lack melanin altogether—are too wise and set in their ways to be affected. Tanning may affect the melanin in the hair as well, so patients are discouraged from sunbathing before their treatment.,What to Expect,Although there are different types of laser hair-removal devices, most have the same basic functionality. In a typical treatment, a technician presses a handheld laser device against a target area, emitting a quick pulse of light that can treat multiple hairs at once in a split second; for most patients, this will feel like someone is pinching the area of skin being treated. Most devices also have a gentle vacuum on the end that sucks hair and skin toward the laser emission, making it easier to target the follicles.",Brazilian Laser Center,"Limited Time Remaining!,300+ viewed today,48 Ratings",Laser Hair-Removal Treatments for a Small or Large Area at Brazilian Laser Center (Up to 92% Off),Brazilian Laser Center,New York,48 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/brazilian-laser-center-1

Check out our guide to help you choose the right one for you.,Both waxing styles involve using hot wax to remove hair from the area below the waist, but the distinction lies in the degree of hair being removed. During a basic bikini wax, an aesthetician removes hair from any area exposed by a typical bathing suit made of fig leaves. This includes the top and sides of the bikini line as well as the inner thighs, if necessary. The Brazilian wax takes it a step further, removing hair from the entire region, front to back. Since many clients prefer to leave a small, trimmed swath of hair in a strip or triangle just below the panty line, some aestheticians may use the term “full Brazilian” to refer to a session in which no hair is left behind.,Naturally, due to the sensitivity of the areas involved, Brazilians tend to be more painful than basic bikini waxes, and most aestheticians will take care to avoid causing pain during the procedure. There are also several steps you can take to minimize discomfort. Experts recommend avoiding any appointment within a week of menstruation, when the skin is most sensitive, and taking an anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen 30 minutes beforehand can help reduce any swelling that results.",Bloomfield Wax and Skincare Center,"Limited Time Remaining!,Selling fast!,841 Ratings",One or Two Brazilian Waxes at Bloomfield Wax and Skincare Center (Up to 55% Off),Upper Roseville,New York,841 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/bloomfield-wax-and-skincare-center

Check out our guide to help you choose the right one for you.,Both waxing styles involve using hot wax to remove hair from the area below the waist, but the distinction lies in the degree of hair being removed. During a basic bikini wax, an aesthetician removes hair from any area exposed by a typical bathing suit made of fig leaves. This includes the top and sides of the bikini line as well as the inner thighs, if necessary. The Brazilian wax takes it a step further, removing hair from the entire region, front to back. Since many clients prefer to leave a small, trimmed swath of hair in a strip or triangle just below the panty line, some aestheticians may use the term “full Brazilian” to refer to a session in which no hair is left behind.,Naturally, due to the sensitivity of the areas involved, Brazilians tend to be more painful than basic bikini waxes, and most aestheticians will take care to avoid causing pain during the procedure. There are also several steps you can take to minimize discomfort. Experts recommend avoiding any appointment within a week of menstruation, when the skin is most sensitive, and taking an anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen 30 minutes beforehand can help reduce any swelling that results.",Blossom Brows Threading Salon,"Limited Time Remaining!,40+ viewed today,368 Ratings",One or Two Brazilian Waxes at Blossom Brows Threading Salon (Up to 51% Off),Upper East Side,New York,368 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/blossom-brows-threading-salon

Kickboxing is many disciplines in one, incorporating moves and techniques from many martial arts.,Punches, kicks, elbows, clinches, and takedowns are all fair game. As such, styles can vary widely among martial-arts purists, boxers, and fighters who work to cultivate a unique approach.,2. Its versatility translates well to fitness.,Kickboxing balances upper- and lower-body flexibility with cardiovascular exercise, making for an effective full-body workout. Practitioners also get the benefit of learning self-defense techniques, getting a leg up on their peers who only know how to chuck a treadmill at an attacker.,3. It’s not that old.,Kickboxing is quite popular in Thailand, which is also home to Muay Thai—a form of boxing, practiced as a regulated sport since the late 19th century, in which fighters don gloves and other pads. In 1966, a Japanese karate promoter became infatuated with Muay Thai—and particularly the full-contact striking that’s not allowed in karate—and saw an opportunity to blend the styles. He prepared three karate fighters to take on Muay Thai specialists, and the competition was fierce enough to inspire the birth, a few years later, of kickboxing as an organized sport.",CKO Kickboxing Gramercy,"Limited Time Remaining!,90+ viewed today,102 Ratings",Three or Six Kickboxing Classes at CKO Kickboxing Gramercy (Up to 79%  Off),Midtown Manhattan,New York,102 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/cko-kickboxing-gramercy

Check out Groupon’s guide to help you tell the stylist how you want to look.,Beyond keeping hair out of your eyes or providing easy access to your brain’s escape hatch, the way you part your hair can reflect how the world perceives you—and how you perceive yourself. How to part it depends largely on the shape of your face. Here are a few basic guidelines to finding the right method:,Heart:,With their wider cheekbones and glowing foreheads, heart-shaped faces radiate with either a side or diagonal part. However, if you have longer hair, a middle part may help to balance out your prominent cheeks.,Square:,The trick with a square-shaped face is to soften its features. A deep-side part or diagonal part allows hair to fall gently over any sharp angles, rounding them out. In this case, it’s best to begin the part right above the arch of one eyebrow.,Circle:,A slightly diagonal part that stretches from the middle of the forehead to the back of the hair lends a dramatic curtain effect to circle-shaped faces, enhancing and elongating the features on the side with the greater exposure.,Oval:,Oval-shaped faces have it toughest of all, since they’re doomed to be able to pull off any look they want. The choices are virtually infinite. Part it down the middle or down either side. Don’t part it at all. Part it six times—the world is your oyster cracker. However, many stylists would recommend a middle part, since side parts already suit the shapes above.,The decision of,where,to part the hair, however, isn’t completely cosmetic. Some people theorize, for example, that a left part indicates someone with strong leadership skills. This theory earned some cred during the 2000 US presidential election, when left-parting George W. Bush defeated right-parting Al Gore. Even comic books lend it some credence, as the unassuming Clark Kent switches his part from the right to the left when he becomes the all-powerful Superman. Still, it could be just a coincidence—many successful leaders part their hair on the right or not at all, and either way, the decision is not always up for debate; a cowlick, for instance, is nearly impossible to tame, often forcing you to adapt your style to suit it.,Whichever part you choose, heed these words: even if the person you see in the mirror seems meek, the world may still see you as powerful. As posited in an,episode,of NPR’s Radiolab, humans tend to favor the version of themselves they see in the mirror, but others will always see them as the opposite image. Our perception of ourselves is inherently flawed. Therefore, if you like the way your hair looks parted to the left, you may want to actually part it to the,right,, even—and perhaps especially—if it looks strange in the mirror.",Hair by Felice Torrone,"Limited Time Remaining!,Up to 67% Off,17 Ratings",Men's Haircuts at Hair by Felice Torrone (Up to 67% Off).

Check out Groupon’s guide to hair growth to learn the science behind strands.,Hair varies in thickness and length across our body, from the head’s massive jungle to the knuckles’ tiny brambles. But regardless of where it is, each strand of hair cycles through three phases: anagen, also known as the active growth phase; catagen, or transitional phase; and telogen, or resting phase. During the growth phase, a new hair shaft sprouts from a follicle as its cells rapidly divide and grow upward, forming tightly packed bundles rich with keratin protein. Next, the transition phase kicks in for about two to three weeks, during which growth stops and the outer root sheath shrinks, anchoring the hair to the follicle as it enters the final phase. At that point, the follicle lies dormant until the hair is shed and the cycle begins again.,Not all hair grows at the same rate. On the scalp, hair grows about 6 inches per year, with each strand spending about two to six years in the active phase. Meanwhile, hair on the arms, legs, eyelids, and eyebrows actively grows for a much shorter period—only about 30–45 days—and spends more time in the resting phase, which is why waxing these areas helps curb unwanted hair growth. Humans need removal methods such as waxing because we don’t shed our hair all at once like other mammals; our hair-growth cycles are random and staggered, whereas other animals’ cycles are mostly synchronized.",Beauty Spa Zone,"Limited Time Remaining!,Up to 54% Off,50 Ratings",One or Two Brazilian Waxes or One Full Leg or Arm Wax at Beauty Spa Zone (Up to 54% Off),New York,New York,50 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/beauty-spa-zone

Read on for a basic overview of this stubborn foe.,Follicle,: the part of the skin that anchors an individual shaft of hair. Each follicle consists of a sebaceous gland, which secretes oil (sebum) to condition the hair and skin, and a few nerve endings at the base that allow hair to carry out one of its main functions: to act as a sensitive touch receptor.,Growth cycles,: during the initial phase of the hair-growth cycle,,anagen,, strands grow up to 0.2 mm per day. This is followed by a,catagen,phase, which lasts two–three weeks, then a,telogen,phase in which hair stops growing. Individual follicles may be at different stages of the cycle at any given time.,Epilation,: the removal of hair from the root. Common methods include tweezing, waxing, laser hair removal, and stapling a tiny eviction notice to every follicle.,Depilation,: the removal of hair from above the skin, usually via shaving or depilation creams, which evolved in the 1930s from formulas used to remove hair from cattle hides.,Jazz bikinis,: the common term for the short skirts worn by flappers in the 1920s—a trend often attributed to the rise of leg shaving as a popular routine.",Professional Threading Studio,"Limited Time Remaining!,Up to 63% Off,14 Ratings",Body Waxing or Eyelash Tinting at Professional Threading Studio (Up to 63% Off).

Check out our guide to help you choose the right one for you.,Both waxing styles involve using hot wax to remove hair from the area below the waist, but the distinction lies in the degree of hair being removed. During a basic bikini wax, an aesthetician removes hair from any area exposed by a typical bathing suit made of fig leaves. This includes the top and sides of the bikini line as well as the inner thighs, if necessary. The Brazilian wax takes it a step further, removing hair from the entire region, front to back. Since many clients prefer to leave a small, trimmed swath of hair in a strip or triangle just below the panty line, some aestheticians may use the term “full Brazilian” to refer to a session in which no hair is left behind.,Naturally, due to the sensitivity of the areas involved, Brazilians tend to be more painful than basic bikini waxes, and most aestheticians will take care to avoid causing pain during the procedure. There are also several steps you can take to minimize discomfort. Experts recommend avoiding any appointment within a week of menstruation, when the skin is most sensitive, and taking an anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen 30 minutes beforehand can help reduce any swelling that results.","Precise Brows, Inc.","Limited Time Remaining!,Up to 44% Off,20 Ratings",One or Two Brazilian Chocolate Waxes at Precise Brows (Up to 44% Off),Murray Hill,New York,20 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/precise-brows-inc

Read our guide of the process to prepare for your trip to the salon.,A skilled stylist doesn’t need a pair of scissors to transform a hairdo. The precise application of highlights—which isolate select strands of hair and treat them with a color, lightener, or toner—can become the basis for a brand new look without a single snip or shear. Before entering the salon, however, a client has to decide how much of the hair to highlight. Applied evenly throughout the entire head, full highlights create a natural look that mimics the way hair changes color over time in the sun, adding a sense of dimension and texture to the existing hair. Partial highlights, which are typically cheaper and take less time to apply, serve an altogether different purpose: drawing attention to specific features, such as bangs or newly sharpened antlers, by accenting only the locks on the surface. As a result, partial highlights are somewhat less flexible—losing their effect, for example, when putting your hair up or teasing it out.",NY Elite Hair Salon,"Limited Time Remaining!,Up to 62% Off,105 Ratings","Haircut, Style, and Deep Conditioning with Optional Highlights or Color at NY Elite Hair Salon (Up to 62% Off)",Upper East Side,New York,105 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/ny-elite-unisex-hair-salon

Read on to see what makes it so special.,Natural-looking yet genetics-defying eyelashes: that’s the goal of eyelash-extension salons. Each tiny extension is attached to an existing lash with a special kind of medical-grade glue that disappears into the lashes so clients can forget they weren’t born looking that way. It’s a delicate process performed by highly trained technicians, but it wouldn’t have been invented if not for a common household item: Super Glue.,In 1942, Dr. Harry Coover invented Super Glue by mistake. While trying to formulate a clear plastic to be used for gun sights at Eastman-Kodak during World War II, he and his team found that one substance was so sticky that it was almost impossible to work with—it would bind to just about anything, with no need for heat, pressure, or pleading. The company eventually put it on the market in 1958. Chemically known as a cyanoacrylate, the adhesive eventually found experimental use in the Vietnam War as a way to quickly close wounds and stop excessive bleeding, giving wounded soldiers more time to seek medical help in the field. Eventually the FDA approved forms of it for use in medicine.,Today, different cyanoacrylate formulations are used in dental surgery, to rejoin veins, and in the eyelash salon. Despite its ancestor’s application of bonding skin, eyelash-extension glue is meant to touch the lash only. To avoid contact with the lid, the glue is applied to the extension rather than the natural lash. Then it’s held against the lash with tiny tweezers for the 30–40 seconds it takes for the chemical bond to form—and repeated dozens of times until the lids are as lushly curtained as the client likes.",Lashholic,"Limited Time Remaining!,Up to 55% Off,335 Ratings",Holic Set of Synthetic Mink Lash Extensions with Optional Two-Week Refill at Lashholic (Up to 55% Off),LashHolic,New York,335 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/lashholic

Read on for a basic overview of this stubborn foe.,Follicle,: the part of the skin that anchors an individual shaft of hair. Each follicle consists of a sebaceous gland, which secretes oil (sebum) to condition the hair and skin, and a few nerve endings at the base that allow hair to carry out one of its main functions: to act as a sensitive touch receptor.,Growth cycles,: during the initial phase of the hair-growth cycle,,anagen,, strands grow up to 0.2 mm per day. This is followed by a,catagen,phase, which lasts two–three weeks, then a,telogen,phase in which hair stops growing. Individual follicles may be at different stages of the cycle at any given time.,Epilation,: the removal of hair from the root. Common methods include tweezing, waxing, laser hair removal, and stapling a tiny eviction notice to every follicle.,Depilation,: the removal of hair from above the skin, usually via shaving or depilation creams, which evolved in the 1930s from formulas used to remove hair from cattle hides.,Jazz bikinis,: the common term for the short skirts worn by flappers in the 1920s—a trend often attributed to the rise of leg shaving as a popular routine.",The Waxing Factory,"Limited Time Remaining!,Up to 40% Off,123 Ratings",$18 for One Men's Chocolate Back Waxing at The Waxing Factory ($30 Value),Upper East Side,New York,123 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/the-waxing-factory-2

Check out Groupon’s guide to hair growth to learn the science behind strands.,Hair varies in thickness and length across our body, from the head’s massive jungle to the knuckles’ tiny brambles. But regardless of where it is, each strand of hair cycles through three phases: anagen, also known as the active growth phase; catagen, or transitional phase; and telogen, or resting phase. During the growth phase, a new hair shaft sprouts from a follicle as its cells rapidly divide and grow upward, forming tightly packed bundles rich with keratin protein. Next, the transition phase kicks in for about two to three weeks, during which growth stops and the outer root sheath shrinks, anchoring the hair to the follicle as it enters the final phase. At that point, the follicle lies dormant until the hair is shed and the cycle begins again.,Not all hair grows at the same rate. On the scalp, hair grows about 6 inches per year, with each strand spending about two to six years in the active phase. Meanwhile, hair on the arms, legs, eyelids, and eyebrows actively grows for a much shorter period—only about 30–45 days—and spends more time in the resting phase, which is why waxing these areas helps curb unwanted hair growth.

"Local,Beauty & Spas,Hair Removal,Bikini Wax","What You'll Get,Choose Between Two Options,$32 for one Brazilian wax ($65 value),$79 for three Brazilian waxes ($195 value),Below the Belt: Choosing Between a Brazilian and a Bikini Wax,The difference between a bikini and Brazilian wax is simple yet significant. Check out our guide to help you choose the right one for you.,Both waxing styles involve using hot wax to remove hair from the area below the waist, but the distinction lies in the degree of hair being removed. During a basic bikini wax, an aesthetician removes hair from any area exposed by a typical bathing suit made of fig leaves. This includes the top and sides of the bikini line as well as the inner thighs, if necessary. The Brazilian wax takes it a step further, removing hair from the entire region, front to back. Since many clients prefer to leave a small, trimmed swath of hair in a strip or triangle just below the panty line, some aestheticians may use the term “full Brazilian” to refer to a session in which no hair is left behind.,Naturally, due to the sensitivity of the areas involved, Brazilians tend to be more painful than basic bikini waxes, and most aestheticians will take care to avoid causing pain during the procedure. There are also several steps you can take to minimize discomfort. Experts recommend avoiding any appointment within a week of menstruation, when the skin is most sensitive, and taking an anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen 30 minutes beforehand can help reduce any swelling that results.",Baire Hair Removal Specialists,"Limited Time Remaining!,20+ viewed today,114 Ratings",One or Three Brazilian Waxes at Baire Hair Removal Specialists (Up to 59% Off),Hell's Kitchen,New York,114 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/baire-hair-removal-specialists

"Local,Food & Drink,Cafes & Treats,Ice Cream","What You'll Get,The Deal,$11 for two cups of ice cream rolls ($16 value),Food Cravings: Giving in to Science,You never know when a hankering is going to strike. Feed your need for knowledge with Groupon’s study of food cravings.,For years, scientists believed that food cravings were linked to nutrient deficiencies—a taste for steak might signify a lack of iron, for instance. But recent research has uncovered a different theory. A functional MRI study cited by the,Wall Street Journal,suggested that food cravings are more similar to an addiction, triggered by reward centers in the brain that relate to memory and emotion. Answering to the craving can trigger the release of neurotransmitters including endorphins (which produce feelings of well-being) and dopamine (which produces the sense of receiving a reward), explaining why we turn to less-than-wholesome “comfort” foods in times of stress.,Nutritionists would love it if we only craved broccoli seasoned with calcium chews, but the reality is that most hankerings tend toward the unhealthy. A survey of college students at an Ontario university found that 97% of women experienced occasional intense cravings, often for carb-loaded foods such as chocolate, donuts, and chips. In the same survey, 68% of men also reported food cravings, though usually for high-fat proteins such as burgers, steaks, and pizza. As you might expect from the “comfort” theory of food cravings, the results of such surveys change drastically depending on the culture.,Although humans may not normally crave foods based on nutritional need, it is true that weightlifters seem to actively crave muscle-building carbs and proteins such as potatoes and pasta. That’s because the body can adjust its cravings to be able to perform everyday activities more efficiently. Sports scientist Dr. David Stensel and his colleagues found that runners crave hydrating fruits and cold-water swimmers crave fatty foods that will provide protective padding, just as professional Scrabble players crave alphabet soup.",Penguin Ice Cream,"Limited Time Remaining!,100+ viewed today,1,027 Ratings",$11 for Two Cups of Thai-Style Ice Cream Rolls with Three Toppings at Penguin Ice Cream ($16 Value),Bowery,New York,"1,027 Ratings",https://www.groupon.com/deals/penguin-ice-cream

Peruse our exploration of acupoint therapy to pinpoint the facts on these ancient techniques.,Despite their different names, acupuncture and acupressure rely on the same principle: the stimulation of the body to trigger natural processes. During typical treatments, licensed acupuncturists target specific bodily points by applying pressure with their hands or a dull implement (in acupressure) or inserting fine needles (for acupuncture). These points correspond to meridians, which, according to the practice’s underlying philosophy, are channels that transport life-giving energy throughout the body. By stimulating the meridians, the acupuncturist releases any blockers to this energy flow and restores the body to health.,Compared to the constantly evolving field of modern medicine, acupuncture has remained essentially unchanged for millennia. Evidence suggests that the treatment existed as far back as 5,000 years ago—the preserved mummy Ötzi the Iceman, for example, bears tattoos that correspond to classical acupuncture points. While contemporary scientific understanding has cast a new light on the body’s inner workings, acupuncture remains a popular procedure with mainstream credibility: a 2002 World Health Organization report found that acupuncture can be an effective treatment for conditions ranging from gout to certain respiratory disorders and acknowledged that “its effective rate in the treatment of chronic pain is comparable with that of morphine.”",City Acupuncture - East Village,"Limited Time Remaining!,50+ viewed today,152 Ratings",One or Two Acupuncture Sessions at City Acupuncture - East Village (Up to 52% Off),Alphabet City,New York,152 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/city-acupuncture-east-village

Check out Groupon's guide to hair growth to learn the science behind strands.,Hair varies in thickness and length across our body, from the head's massive jungle to the knuckles' tiny brambles. But regardless of where it is, each strand of hair cycles through three phases: anagen, also known as the active growth phase; catagen, or transitional phase; and telogen, or resting phase. During the growth phase, a new hair shaft sprouts from a follicle as its cells rapidly divide and grow upward, forming tightly packed bundles rich with keratin protein. Next, the transition phase kicks in for about two to three weeks, during which growth stops and the outer root sheath shrinks, anchoring the hair to the follicle as it enters the final phase. At that point, the follicle lies dormant until the hair is shed and the cycle begins again.,Not all hair grows at the same rate. On the scalp, hair grows about 6 inches per year, with each strand spending about two to six years in the active phase. Meanwhile, hair on the arms, legs, eyelids, and eyebrows actively grows for a much shorter period—only about 30–45 days—and spends more time in the resting phase, which is why waxing these areas helps curb unwanted hair growth. Humans need removal methods such as waxing because we don't shed our hair all at once like other mammals; our hair-growth cycles are random and staggered, whereas other animals' cycles are mostly synchronized.",Organic Element Spa NY,"Limited Time Remaining!,Up to 64% Off,1,533 Ratings",One or Three Brazilian Waxes at Organic Element Spa NY (Up to 64% Off),Midtown Manhattan,New York,"1,533 Ratings",https://www.groupon.com/deals/organic-element-spa-ny-1

Feed your need for knowledge with Groupon’s study of food cravings.,For years, scientists believed that food cravings were linked to nutrient deficiencies—a taste for steak might signify a lack of iron, for instance. But recent research has uncovered a different theory. A functional MRI study cited by the,Wall Street Journal,suggested that food cravings are more similar to an addiction, triggered by reward centers in the brain that relate to memory and emotion. Answering to the craving can trigger the release of neurotransmitters including endorphins (which produce feelings of well-being) and dopamine (which produces the sense of receiving a reward), explaining why we turn to less-than-wholesome “comfort” foods in times of stress.,Nutritionists would love it if we only craved broccoli seasoned with calcium chews, but the reality is that most hankerings tend toward the unhealthy. A survey of college students at an Ontario university found that 97% of women experienced occasional intense cravings, often for carb-loaded foods such as chocolate, donuts, and chips. In the same survey, 68% of men also reported food cravings, though usually for high-fat proteins such as burgers, steaks, and pizza. As you might expect from the “comfort” theory of food cravings, the results of such surveys change drastically depending on the culture.,Although humans may not normally crave foods based on nutritional need, it is true that weightlifters seem to actively crave muscle-building carbs and proteins such as potatoes and pasta. That’s because the body can adjust its cravings to be able to perform everyday activities more efficiently. Sports scientist Dr. David Stensel and his colleagues found that runners crave hydrating fruits and cold-water swimmers crave fatty foods that will provide protective padding, just as professional Scrabble players crave alphabet soup.",Avenue Diner,"Limited Time Remaining!,60+ viewed today,201 Ratings","Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner at Avenue Diner (Up to 50% Off).

Check out Groupon’s study of the science behind their constant regeneration.,Whether replacing fat cells at the rate of 10% each year or spawning new skin cells by the minute, the human body is in a constant state of regeneration. Besides our hair, nowhere is this continual growth and change more evident than in the nails. Highly vulnerable to chips and snags, fingernails compensate for the abuse by growing approximately 0.1 inch per month, regenerating completely in around four to six months. Toenails, by contrast, grow at a rate about three to four times slower, taking up to 18 months to fully bloom again.,The process begins beneath the skin’s surface just above the first knuckle, at a site known as the nail root, or nail matrix, which produces the tough, transparent keratin protein that makes up each nail. From this subcutaneous factory, the nail crawls across the flat, sensitive portion of skin called the nail bed, continuously growing until it’s either trimmed or gets stuck in a filing-cabinet keyhole. As the nail continues to sprout, the outer tissue on its bottom edge—called the eponychium—and the skin that frames it on the sides—called the folds—hold it in place and protect it against foreign invaders such as dirt, bacteria, and water. Along the way, dead skin cells from the eponychium embed themselves to the nail plate—forming the pale, crescent-shaped layer known as the cuticle, which functions as a sort of dam sealing off the eponychium and further protecting the body from impurities.,In a study attempting to explain why the growing rate of British thumbnails have increased from 3 millimeters (about 0.12 inches) per month in 1938 to 3.55 millimeters (about 0.14 inches) today, researchers at the University of North Carolina proposed this theory: “A rapid change in the environment, lifestyle and health conditions—such as diet, physical activity and body composition—has occurred over the past 30 years.” Indeed, there are a number of variables that determine how fast a nail springs forth. The amount of vitamin D a person receives, for instance, has shown to affect growth, so nails tend to flourish faster in the plentiful sunlight of summer. Age is another factor—children grow their nails at an incredibly fast rate until reaching puberty, at which point their nail growth slows down by 50%. Even right- or left-handedness plays a role, as nails tend to come in more quickly on the dominant hand, which is why volleyball players spike with their opposite hand to avoid popping the ball.",Spa For Life,"Limited Time Remaining!,150+ viewed today,1,008 Ratings","One Mani-Pedi or Three vouchers, Each Good for One Mani-Pedi at Spa for Life (50% Off)",Chinatown,New York,"1,008 Ratings",https://www.groupon.com/deals/spa-for-life

Begin to navigate these pathways with Groupon’s exploration of acupuncture meridians.,Like currents in the air, acupuncture meridians—as postulated by traditional Chinese medicine—are invisible paths of action in the body. Acupuncture theory holds that a person’s life force, or chi, flows along specific channels from organ to organ. When chi becomes unbalanced or blocked, health and wellness problems arise, such as digestive trouble or a bicep that looks like a creepy face when you flex. It’s the acupuncturist’s job to unblock chi by inserting thin needles into carefully chosen points along these pathways.,Twelve primary meridians flow through the body, each categorized as yin or yang (roughly defined as the passive and active forces within nature). Each meridian corresponds to a specific organ, element, and set of emotions. For instance, the lung meridian flows through the arm and is associated with yin and metal; should its flow of energy be disturbed, feelings of grief and sadness may manifest. For each condition an acupuncturist seeks to assuage, a timetable dictates when each meridian is most active and therefore easiest to treat. With so many complexities to keep in mind, it’s easy to understand why acupuncturists must undertake thousands of hours of coursework to become licensed.,So far, doctors and scientists have had little luck mapping meridians to visible anatomical structures, but some studies have uncovered overlap between ancient and modern medicine. For example, meridians tend to fall along planes between muscles, or between a muscle and bone or tendon—areas usually rich with connective tissue. A 2010,study,published in,PLOS One,made one further connection: bands of collagenous tissue, in particular, present less opposition to the flow of electricity than other areas of the body. These bands underlie some—though not all—primary meridians, suggesting that the energy known as chi may be related in some way to the energy that zips through our power lines and singing toothbrushes.",Columbus Circle Acupuncture Wellness,"Limited Time Remaining!,Up to 86% Off,164 Ratings",$36 for an Acupuncture Assessment and Treatment at Columbus Circle Acupuncture Wellness ($250 Value),Columbus Circle Acupuncture Wellness,New York,164 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/bravo-texas-acupuncture-wellness-1

Groupon’s study of this sticky subject shows how this method leaves you silky smooth.,Hot and sticky: that’s strip wax. When heated, it attains a consistency similar to honey. It takes its name from what happens next—the waxer lays cloth strips over the molten surface, getting a good handle on the otherwise messy stuff. She then swiftly tugs on the strip against the direction of hair growth, pulling off the wax and any hairs caught in its grip.,Also known as soft wax, strip wax is deal for deforesting large areas, such as the legs or chest, because it can be done swiftly and in significant swathes. The wax itself does stick directly to the skin, which means it can remove a tiny bit of surface skin and cause irritation for those with sensitive skin.

Read on to see what makes it so special.,Natural-looking yet genetics-defying eyelashes: that’s the goal of eyelash-extension salons. Each tiny extension is attached to an existing lash with a special kind of medical-grade glue that disappears into the lashes so clients can forget they weren’t born looking that way. It’s a delicate process performed by highly trained technicians, but it wouldn’t have been invented if not for a common household item: Super Glue.,In 1942, Dr. Harry Coover invented Super Glue by mistake. While trying to formulate a clear plastic to be used for gun sights at Eastman-Kodak during World War II, he and his team found that one substance was so sticky that it was almost impossible to work with—it would bind to just about anything, with no need for heat, pressure, or pleading. The company eventually put it on the market in 1958. Chemically known as a cyanoacrylate, the adhesive eventually found experimental use in the Vietnam War as a way to quickly close wounds and stop excessive bleeding, giving wounded soldiers more time to seek medical help in the field. Eventually the FDA approved forms of it for use in medicine.,Today, different cyanoacrylate formulations are used in dental surgery, to rejoin veins, and in the eyelash salon. Despite its ancestor’s application of bonding skin, eyelash-extension glue is meant to touch the lash only. To avoid contact with the lid, the glue is applied to the extension rather than the natural lash. Then it’s held against the lash with tiny tweezers for the 30–40 seconds it takes for the chemical bond to form—and repeated dozens of times until the lids are as lushly curtained as the client likes.",Midtown Lashes,"Limited Time Remaining!,Selling fast!,15 Ratings",Full Set of Mink Eyelash Extensions with 70 or 100 Lashes at Midtown Lashes (Up to 59% Off),Midtown Manhattan,New York,15 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/midtown-lashes

Read on to learn the philosophy and history behind those shrinking letters.,According to the,Seattle Times,, the best-selling poster in the United States isn’t of Indiana Jones or the cover to Pink Floyd’s,Generic World Map,. It’s the eye chart, those iconic rows of decreasingly sized letters that grace optometrists’ offices throughout the country. Aesthetics aside, the ubiquitous chart primarily tests visual acuity, which the,American Optometric Association,summarizes as “the clarity or sharpness of vision.” Patients typically stand around 20 feet from the wall, cover one eye, and identify the smallest row of letters they can individually distinguish. Commonly, this boils patients’ visual acuities down to a fraction in which the denominator represents how many feet away a person of normal visual acuity could stand while still discerning the letters with the same level of clarity as the patient. In other words, 20/40 vision means the patient needs to stand 20 feet away to make out the same size letters as a person with standard vision can from 40 feet.,These fractions were the brainchild of Herman Snellen, a Dutch ophthalmologist who designed the first popular rendition of an eye chart in the 1860s. The original versions of Snellen’s chart included nine letters—C, D, E, F, L, O, P, T, and Z—as,optotypes,—a term for standardized symbols used to test vision. However, there was room for improvement in Snellen’s design; the spacing wasn’t quite standardized, and different versions incorporated serif as well as sans serif fonts. Over the years, the Snellen chart has adopted more uniform spacing and cleaner optotypes, and a few alternatives have sprung up for use in other settings. For instance, scientists prefer a chart designed by two Australian optometrists for its logarithmic progression of letter size, and one variation simply orients the single letter ‘E’ in different directions, making the test easier for patients who are illiterate or unfamiliar with the Roman alphabet.,For all their value, eye charts are still only capable of assessing visual acuity, not vision in general. Full eye exams almost invariably include a staring contest with an eye chart, but optometrists also use different tools to test everything from peripheral awareness and depth perception to focusing ability and color vision.",Cohen's Fashion Optical,"Limited Time Remaining!,60+ viewed today,41 Ratings",Eye Exam with $385 Credit Towards Complete Designer Frames with Lenses (92% Off),Cohen's Fashion Optical,New York,41 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/cohen-s-fashion-optical-660-lexington-ave-1

The pastime employs the same level of stamina, coordination, and flexibility found in other notable Olympic disciplines. As a combination of gymnastic movements and dance, pole fitness acts as both an anaerobic and aerobic workout: proficient dancers twist, climb, and glissade around poles, supporting and controlling their own body weight with a seemingly effortless grace. The men and women who practice pole dancing on a regular basis often report improvement not just in strength, but also self-confidence and body image.,Although once pegged as a controversial erotic performance art, pole dancing has rapidly blossomed into an internationally respected form of fitness, boasting more than 500 studios in the United States alone. Even without a slot on the Olympic schedule of events, practitioners of the demanding exercise genre perform at amateur and professional competitions throughout the world each year.",Femme Body Fitness,"Limited Time Remaining!,150+ viewed today,429 Ratings","Two, Five, or Ten Pole-Dancing and Sexy-Fitness Classes at Femme Body Fitness (Up to 57% Off)",Midtown Manhattan,New York,429 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/femme-body-fitness

"Local,Beauty & Spas,Hair Removal,Bikini Wax","What You'll Get,Choice of:,One Chocolate Brazilian Wax,One Cream Brazilian Wax,Three Chocolate Brazilian Waxes,Below the Belt: Choosing Between a Brazilian and a Bikini Wax,The difference between a bikini and Brazilian wax is simple yet significant. Check out our guide to help you choose the right one for you.,Both waxing styles involve using hot wax to remove hair from the area below the waist, but the distinction lies in the degree of hair being removed. During a basic bikini wax, an aesthetician removes hair from any area exposed by a typical bathing suit made of fig leaves. This includes the top and sides of the bikini line as well as the inner thighs, if necessary. The Brazilian wax takes it a step further, removing hair from the entire region, front to back. Since many clients prefer to leave a small, trimmed swath of hair in a strip or triangle just below the panty line, some aestheticians may use the term “full Brazilian” to refer to a session in which no hair is left behind.,Naturally, due to the sensitivity of the areas involved, Brazilians tend to be more painful than basic bikini waxes, and most aestheticians will take care to avoid causing pain during the procedure. There are also several steps you can take to minimize discomfort. Experts recommend avoiding any appointment within a week of menstruation, when the skin is most sensitive, and taking an anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen 30 minutes beforehand can help reduce any swelling that results.",The Waxing Factory,"Limited Time Remaining!,100+ viewed today,123 Ratings","One Cream Brazilian Wax, or One or Three Chocolate Brazilian Waxes at The Waxing Factory (Up to 54% Off)",Upper East Side,New York,123 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/the-waxing-factory-3

####Body Hair: Getting to the Root,Body hair can be unsightly, but it’s all part of a natural process. Read on for a basic overview of this stubborn foe.,Follicle,: the part of the skin that anchors an individual shaft of hair. Each follicle consists of a sebaceous gland, which secretes oil (sebum) to condition the hair and skin, and a few nerve endings at the base that allow hair to carry out one of its main functions: to act as a sensitive touch receptor.,Growth cycles,: during the initial phase of the hair-growth cycle,,anagen,, strands grow up to 0.2 mm per day. This is followed by a,catagen,phase, which lasts two–three weeks, then a,telogen,phase in which hair stops growing. Individual follicles may be at different stages of the cycle at any given time.,Epilation,: the removal of hair from the root. Common methods include tweezing, waxing, laser hair removal, and stapling a tiny eviction notice to every follicle.,Depilation,: the removal of hair from above the skin, usually via shaving or depilation creams, which evolved in the 1930s from formulas used to remove hair from cattle hides.,Jazz bikinis,: the common term for the short skirts worn by flappers in the 1920s—a trend often attributed to the rise of leg shaving as a popular routine.",Unique Threading Salon,"Limited Time Remaining!,Up to 51% Off,16 Ratings",Brazilian or Eyebrow Wax or Eyebrow Threading at Unique Threading Salon (Up to 51% Off),Midtown Manhattan,New York,16 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/unique-threading-salon-1-3

 an art to creating flattering eyebrows. Here are some of the guidelines
 a stylist follows to get brows looking full and natural.,1. 
The eyebrow shape should follow the natural brow line.,Be it straight,
 curved, or arched, your original brow shape will be the one that works 
best with your facial structure and any accessories you came packaged 
with. Of course, that doesn’t mean all hairs are where you want them. A 
brow stylist will often begin by getting rid of any hairs that fall 
below that line before they continue shaping.,2. Brows’ 
starting and ending points are set in bone.,The inner edge of your 
eyebrows should start where the outside of your nose meets the brow 
bone. Plucking too far in makes brows appear too short, a common at-home
 mistake that can take weeks to remedy. To get a preview of where your 
brows should end, place the tip of a pencil at the outside of your 
nostril and angle it so that it touches the outer corner of the eye. 
Where the pencil touches the brow bone is where the outer brow edge 
should stop.,3. Your brow artist will look you straight in the 
eye.,That’s in order to pinpoint the outer edge of your eye’s iris. 
The highest part of the arch should hit right above it, and everything 
beyond that point begins to taper off.,4. Plucking isn’t 
everything.,After the shaping is done, it’s time for a different kind 
of artistry. To create a full, smooth look that eliminates any suspicion
 that your brows got in a fight with each other, the stylist may go back
 in to sharpen or soften angles or fill in thinner areas with a brow 
pencil or powder.",Blossom Brows Threading Salon,"Limited Time Remaining!,50+ viewed today,370 Ratings",Eyebrow Wax and Tint or Eyelash Tint at Blossom Brows Threading Salon (Up to 58% Off).

Learn what holds your california roll together with Groupon’s guide to this sensational seaweed.,Sushi is common enough today that most people recognize nori, the dark-green or purple seaweed paper that encases each roll’s ingredients. Not only does nori keep sushi from falling apart, it adds a dose of vitamins and minerals including calcium, iron, and potassium to each bite.,In the past, farmers simply plucked naturally grown algae from the sea, cleaned off all the mermaid hairs, and dried it into nori. Today, its life cycle begins in a building that may resemble a swimming pool or bathhouse at first glance: a big, sunny seedling center lined with wide, shallow tanks of seawater. Each tank is lined with oyster shells, which act as mineral-rich food for Porphyra spores. After they’ve been feeding and growing for about five months, it’s time to seed the nets. Rotating drums are wound with synthetic nets, then spun through the tanks for 20–60 minutes to become saturated with spores.,At that point, the operation moves to the sea, where the nets are attached to bamboo poles to continue their life and grow into long, ragged pennants amid the tides. Once harvested, the plants are washed, ground into a pulp, and flattened into sheets. Finally, the sheets are toasted, graded, and readied for consumption, either as the partly rehydrated casing around sushi rolls or by themselves for a snack as healthy and crunchy as toasted Flintstones vitamins.",Kikoo Sushi,"Limited Time Remaining!,550+ viewed today,3,827 Ratings","Two Hours of All-You-Can-Eat Sushi, Sashimi & Teriyaki Dinner with Drinks at Kikoo Sushi (Up to 53% Off)",New York,New York,"3,827 Ratings",https://www.groupon.com/deals/kikoo-sushi
