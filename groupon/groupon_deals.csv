"Local,Health & Fitness,Natural Medicine,Acupuncture","What You'll Get,Choose Between Two Options,$24 for one acupuncture session ($49 value),$47 for two acupuncture sessions ($98 value),Acupuncture and Acupressure: Hitting the Spots,Acupuncture and its sister treatment, acupressure, have endured for centuries. Peruse our exploration of acupoint therapy to pinpoint the facts on these ancient techniques.,Despite their different names, acupuncture and acupressure rely on the same principle: the stimulation of the body to trigger natural processes. During typical treatments, licensed acupuncturists target specific bodily points by applying pressure with their hands or a dull implement (in acupressure) or inserting fine needles (for acupuncture). These points correspond to meridians, which, according to the practice’s underlying philosophy, are channels that transport life-giving energy throughout the body. By stimulating the meridians, the acupuncturist releases any blockers to this energy flow and restores the body to health.,Compared to the constantly evolving field of modern medicine, acupuncture has remained essentially unchanged for millennia. Evidence suggests that the treatment existed as far back as 5,000 years ago—the preserved mummy Ötzi the Iceman, for example, bears tattoos that correspond to classical acupuncture points. While contemporary scientific understanding has cast a new light on the body’s inner workings, acupuncture remains a popular procedure with mainstream credibility: a 2002 World Health Organization report found that acupuncture can be an effective treatment for conditions ranging from gout to certain respiratory disorders and acknowledged that “its effective rate in the treatment of chronic pain is comparable with that of morphine.”",City Acupuncture - East Village,"Limited Time Remaining!,50+ viewed today,152 Ratings",One or Two Acupuncture Sessions at City Acupuncture - East Village (Up to 52% Off),Alphabet City,New York,152 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/city-acupuncture-east-village

Read our guide of the process to prepare for your trip to the salon.,A skilled stylist doesn’t need a pair of scissors to transform a hairdo. The precise application of highlights—which isolate select strands of hair and treat them with a color, lightener, or toner—can become the basis for a brand new look without a single snip or shear. Before entering the salon, however, a client has to decide how much of the hair to highlight. Applied evenly throughout the entire head, full highlights create a natural look that mimics the way hair changes color over time in the sun, adding a sense of dimension and texture to the existing hair. Partial highlights, which are typically cheaper and take less time to apply, serve an altogether different purpose: drawing attention to specific features, such as bangs or newly sharpened antlers, by accenting only the locks on the surface. As a result, partial highlights are somewhat less flexible—losing their effect, for example, when putting your hair up or teasing it out.",Glamour Center Hair Salon,"Limited Time Remaining!,30+ viewed today,10 Ratings",Hair Styling Packages at Glamour Center Hair Salon (Up to 54% Off).

Under dry conditions, the tiny scales that cover its surface become raised and brittle, causing hairs to tangle and lose their shine. Conditioner aims to correct this problem by bonding a particular class of molecules, called cationic surfactants, to the cuticle. This is possible because keratin, the protein that makes up most of the hair shaft, bristles with negative ions, which attract the positively charged surfactants, coating each thread in a thin film that weighs it down and reduces frizz. (The negative charge of keratin is also what causes static whenever positive ions are stripped from the hair—the static that makes it possible to stick a balloon to the wall or to power a miner’s headlamp.),The other ingredients in conditioner don’t always need ions to do their jobs well. Humectants suck in water from the surrounding air, thereby moisturizing the hair, and oils simply penetrate the cuticle. Glossers coat the hair with light-reflecting polymers, increasing shine, whereas other ingredients raise the acidity level of the conditioner, which helps protect the hair’s protein structure.",Evolve Salon,"Limited Time Remaining!,100+ viewed today,171 Ratings","One Haircut, Deep Conditioning, and Blow-Dry or Highlights, Ombre, or Balayage at Evolve Salon (Up to 68% Off)",Evolve Salon,New York,171 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/evolve-salon-4
"Local,Beauty & Spas,Hair Removal,Bikini Wax","What You'll Get,Choose Between Two Options,$25 for one Brazilian chocolate wax ($45 value),$50 for two Brazilian chocolate waxes ($90 value),Below the Belt: Choosing Between a Brazilian and a Bikini Wax,The difference between a bikini and Brazilian wax is simple yet significant. Check out our guide to help you choose the right one for you.,Both waxing styles involve using hot wax to remove hair from the area below the waist, but the distinction lies in the degree of hair being removed. During a basic bikini wax, an aesthetician removes hair from any area exposed by a typical bathing suit made of fig leaves. This includes the top and sides of the bikini line as well as the inner thighs, if necessary. The Brazilian wax takes it a step further, removing hair from the entire region, front to back. Since many clients prefer to leave a small, trimmed swath of hair in a strip or triangle just below the panty line, some aestheticians may use the term “full Brazilian” to refer to a session in which no hair is left behind.,Naturally, due to the sensitivity of the areas involved, Brazilians tend to be more painful than basic bikini waxes, and most aestheticians will take care to avoid causing pain during the procedure. There are also several steps you can take to minimize discomfort. Experts recommend avoiding any appointment within a week of menstruation, when the skin is most sensitive, and taking an anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen 30 minutes beforehand can help reduce any swelling that results.","Precise Brows, Inc.","Limited Time Remaining!,Up to 44% Off,20 Ratings",One or Two Brazilian Chocolate Waxes at Precise Brows (Up to 44% Off),Murray Hill,New York,20 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/precise-brows-inc

Read our guide of the process to prepare for your trip to the salon.,A skilled stylist doesn’t need a pair of scissors to transform a hairdo. The precise application of highlights—which isolate select strands of hair and treat them with a color, lightener, or toner—can become the basis for a brand new look without a single snip or shear. Before entering the salon, however, a client has to decide how much of the hair to highlight. Applied evenly throughout the entire head, full highlights create a natural look that mimics the way hair changes color over time in the sun, adding a sense of dimension and texture to the existing hair. Partial highlights, which are typically cheaper and take less time to apply, serve an altogether different purpose: drawing attention to specific features, such as bangs or newly sharpened antlers, by accenting only the locks on the surface. As a result, partial highlights are somewhat less flexible—losing their effect, for example, when putting your hair up or teasing it out.",Farah Salon & Spa Inc.,"Limited Time Remaining!,30+ viewed today,137 Ratings",Haircut Package with Optional Color or Partial Highlights at Farah Salon & Spa (Up to 68% Off),West Village,New York,137 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/farah-salon-spa-inc

Learn how this works with Groupon’s look into microcurrent therapy.,If the idea of sending electricity into your face seems a little alarming, don’t worry: the currents used to stimulate the skin and muscles during microcurrent therapy pack only one-millionth of the power needed to illuminate a light bulb. What’s more, they’re just adding to the tiny electrical signals running through your body at all times—which is part of the reason they’re used in medicine in the first place. Medical researchers have long noticed that when tissue is injured, the currents that normally run through it tend to be diminished. Physical therapists have accordingly found that electrically stimulating the injured area can help wounds and conditions such as tennis elbow or soccer head heal faster.,Whether these restorative effects extend to improving the condition of healthy tissue isn’t yet clear. Skincare specialists use microcurrent treatments in two different ways: to stimulate the skin and facial muscles for a more toned appearance, and to help water-based products penetrate the skin more effectively. The second application also has a long medical lineage, and consists of using an electrode to drive a water-based serum—which has an existing ionic charge—away from itself and thus into the skin.,The treatment often described as a “nonsurgical face-lift” is meant to make lasting (though not permanent) changes to muscle tone and to increase collagen and elastin production. So far, few studies have been done to assess these effects, possibly because scientists want to keep all the best beauty tips for themselves. But it’s likely that, no matter what, you’ll notice at least some short-term changes. Microcurrent treatments do a great job of stimulating blood flow, so clients tend to leave the spa with a rosier, plumper, and—given the relaxing effects of an ordinary facial—serener complexion.",Self Empowered Minds,"Limited Time Remaining!,10+ viewed today,53 Ratings",60-Minute Microcurrent Skin Treatment with Optional Hair Follicle Test at Self Empowered Minds (Up to 80% Off),Multiple Locations,New York,53 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/self-empowered-minds-3

Read our guide of the process to prepare for your trip to the salon.,A skilled stylist doesn’t need a pair of scissors to transform a hairdo. The precise application of highlights—which isolate select strands of hair and treat them with a color, lightener, or toner—can become the basis for a brand new look without a single snip or shear. Before entering the salon, however, a client has to decide how much of the hair to highlight. Applied evenly throughout the entire head, full highlights create a natural look that mimics the way hair changes color over time in the sun, adding a sense of dimension and texture to the existing hair. Partial highlights, which are typically cheaper and take less time to apply, serve an altogether different purpose: drawing attention to specific features, such as bangs or newly sharpened antlers, by accenting only the locks on the surface. As a result, partial highlights are somewhat less flexible—losing their effect, for example, when putting your hair up or teasing it out.",Nelly Hair & Nail Salon,"Limited Time Remaining!,100+ viewed today,313 Ratings",Haircut and Conditioning with Options for Partial or Full Highlights at Nelly Hair & Nail Salon (Up to 53% Off),Financial District,New York,313 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/nelly-hair-nail-salon

Check out Groupon’s guide to hair growth to learn the science behind strands.,Hair varies in thickness and length across our body, from the head’s massive jungle to the knuckles’ tiny brambles. But regardless of where it is, each strand of hair cycles through three phases: anagen, also known as the active growth phase; catagen, or transitional phase; and telogen, or resting phase. During the growth phase, a new hair shaft sprouts from a follicle as its cells rapidly divide and grow upward, forming tightly packed bundles rich with keratin protein. Next, the transition phase kicks in for about two to three weeks, during which growth stops and the outer root sheath shrinks, anchoring the hair to the follicle as it enters the final phase. At that point, the follicle lies dormant until the hair is shed and the cycle begins again.,Not all hair grows at the same rate. On the scalp, hair grows about 6 inches per year, with each strand spending about two to six years in the active phase. Meanwhile, hair on the arms, legs, eyelids, and eyebrows actively grows for a much shorter period—only about 30–45 days—and spends more time in the resting phase, which is why waxing these areas helps curb unwanted hair growth. Humans need removal methods such as waxing because we don’t shed our hair all at once like other mammals; our hair-growth cycles are random and staggered, whereas other animals’ cycles are mostly synchronized.",Beauty Spa Zone,"Limited Time Remaining!,20+ viewed today,50 Ratings",One or Two Brazilian Waxes or One Full Leg or Arm Wax at Beauty Spa Zone (Up to 54% Off),New York,New York,50 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/beauty-spa-zone

Read on to learn more about how a beam of light results in smooth skin.,Laser hair-removal treatments eliminate unwanted hair using a focused beam of light at a fixed wavelength. This light naturally targets a type of pigment known as melanin—the same chemical responsible for skin tanning—within the hair follicles, heating the follicles that are in their active growth phase to discourage future hairs from sprouting. Because the melanin absorbs the focused light, IPL treatments can eliminate hair while having little impact and causing only limited irritation to surrounding skin cells. However, this basic principle also limits the conditions in which IPL treatments can be effective. Those with darker skin and fairer hair, for instance, may require extra sessions, and gray hairs—that is, hairs that lack melanin altogether—are too wise and set in their ways to be affected. Tanning may affect the melanin in the hair as well, so patients are discouraged from sunbathing before their treatment.,What to Expect,Although there are different types of laser hair-removal devices, most have the same basic functionality. In a typical treatment, a technician presses a handheld laser device against a target area, emitting a quick pulse of light that can treat multiple hairs at once in a split second; for most patients, this will feel like someone is pinching the area of skin being treated. Most devices also have a gentle vacuum on the end that sucks hair and skin toward the laser emission, making it easier to target the follicles.",Brazilian Laser Center,"Limited Time Remaining!,300+ viewed today,48 Ratings",Laser Hair-Removal Treatments for a Small or Large Area at Brazilian Laser Center (Up to 92% Off),Brazilian Laser Center,New York,48 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/brazilian-laser-center-1

The company eventually put it on the market in 1958.

Despite its ancestor’s application of bonding skin, eyelash-extension glue is meant to touch the lash only. To avoid contact with the lid, the glue is applied to the extension rather than the natural lash. Then it’s held against the lash with tiny tweezers for the 30–40 seconds it takes for the chemical bond to form—and repeated dozens of times until the lids are as lushly curtained as the client likes.",Lashholic,"Limited Time Remaining!,80+ viewed today,336 Ratings",Holic Set of Synthetic Mink Lash Extensions with Optional Two-Week Refill at Lashholic (Up to 55% Off),LashHolic,New York,336 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/lashholic

Feed your need for knowledge with Groupon’s study of food cravings.,For years, scientists believed that food cravings were linked to nutrient deficiencies—a taste for steak might signify a lack of iron, for instance. But recent research has uncovered a different theory. A functional MRI study cited by the,Wall Street Journal,suggested that food cravings are more similar to an addiction, triggered by reward centers in the brain that relate to memory and emotion. Answering to the craving can trigger the release of neurotransmitters including endorphins (which produce feelings of well-being) and dopamine (which produces the sense of receiving a reward), explaining why we turn to less-than-wholesome “comfort” foods in times of stress.,Nutritionists would love it if we only craved broccoli seasoned with calcium chews, but the reality is that most hankerings tend toward the unhealthy. A survey of college students at an Ontario university found that 97% of women experienced occasional intense cravings, often for carb-loaded foods such as chocolate, donuts, and chips. In the same survey, 68% of men also reported food cravings, though usually for high-fat proteins such as burgers, steaks, and pizza. As you might expect from the “comfort” theory of food cravings, the results of such surveys change drastically depending on the culture.,Although humans may not normally crave foods based on nutritional need, it is true that weightlifters seem to actively crave muscle-building carbs and proteins such as potatoes and pasta. That’s because the body can adjust its cravings to be able to perform everyday activities more efficiently. Sports scientist Dr. David Stensel and his colleagues found that runners crave hydrating fruits and cold-water swimmers crave fatty foods that will provide protective padding, just as professional Scrabble players crave alphabet soup.",Penguin Ice Cream,"Limited Time Remaining!,100+ viewed today,1,028 Ratings",$11 for Two Cups of Thai-Style Ice Cream Rolls with Three Toppings at Penguin Ice Cream ($16 Value),Bowery,New York,"1,028 Ratings",https://www.groupon.com/deals/penguin-ice-cream

Break free from ammonia with Groupon’s look at ammonia-free hair color.,When you color your hair, the dye doesn’t just cling to the outside of each strand. The reason hair color lasts through scores of shampoos and waterpark visits is because it actually penetrates beneath the cuticle, the outermost layer of hair cells that overlap like a snake’s scales. One of the most time-tested tools to get under the cuticle is ammonia. During the coloring process, ammonia makes the cuticle, which normally lies flat, swell and expand. Color then floods the newly porous strand, remaining inside even after the cuticle relaxes (although it won’t return quite to its former sleek state). As color filters in, protein and moisture leak out, causing damage, dryness, and frizz. Other downsides include ammonia’s strong smell and ability to irritate the scalp, effects that can persist the entire time the color is processing.,If ammonia pries open the cuticle with a crowbar, ammonia-free products seek to gently nudge it ajar. The active ingredient in many ammonia-free hair dyes is called monoethanolamine (MEA). Although MEA lifts the scales of the cuticle much less dramatically, color can still slip easily inside when the chemical is paired with a sneakier oil base, rather than traditional color’s water base. As a bonus, the oil tends to leave behind not only pigment but moisture. Other ammonia-free products employ a combination of heat and fatty acids derived from coconut oil to open cuticle doors. Although some stylists have found that ammonia-free products can’t penetrate as well, making them more prone to fading, others say it’s worth it to get hair that feels less dry or over-processed—and dye manufacturers are constantly improving their formulas in hopes of making the gentler technique the industry standard.",Salon Jasna,"Limited Time Remaining!,60+ viewed today,109 Ratings","Haircut, Blow-Dry, Style, and Optional Color Treatment at Salon Jasna (Up to 80% Off)",New York,New York,109 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/salon-jasna-1

The volume lash set lasts 1–2 weeks and includes 80 eyelashes per eye.,$60.50 for the Bling mink/silk lash set ($120 value),Mink lashes are for those looking for a natural extended look. These lashes are applied individually, one by one, to natural eyelashes and are ideal for those with a naturally-full foundation of lashes who would like to add length. Ranging in sizes from 8–15, they can be tailored to each individual and are completely matte in structure. Mink lashes last 2–3 weeks and include 80 eyelashes per eye.,$70.50 for the Bling luxury lash set ($140 value),Luxury lashes are, of course, the most luxurious option. These lashes are applied individually, one by one, to natural eyelashes and are incredibly soft to the touch. With a hollow center, they weight the least, making them a great option for someone after the most natural extensions. Structurally, this lash is flattened at the base, providing length and volume right at the roots. Luxury lashes are the most versatile option, able to provide styles from natural to full-on dramatic. They’re available in lengths 8–15, last 2–3 weeks, and include 80 eyelashes per eye.,Mink vs. Synthetic Eyelashes: Nature Meets Nylon,To help decide between mink or synthetic extensions, read our comparison.,The results of semipermanent eyelash extensions can range from a simple mascara effect to a doe-eyed gaze that could pry Pac-Man from Ms. Pac-Man. Before technicians decide the best length, thickness, and color of lashes with which to create a client’s desired look, you’ll have a choice to make: mink or synthetic? Read on for a breakdown of the two most common options:,Mink:,Feather-soft mink extensions are comfortable to wear and because each lash is an actual hair, they blend in seamlessly with natural lashes. The result is fringe that appears lusher, though not necessarily longer or darker depending on the look of your natural eyelashes.,Mink eyelash extensions are cruelty-free since their individual hairs are brushed harmlessly from the coats of live siberian mink. The hairs then undergo a careful sanitization process to make them hypoallergenic and safe to wear, even for people with animal allergies.,Synthetic:,Less expensive than their mink counterparts, nylon lashes are practically ubiquitous and come in many varieties: natural, neon colored, crystal studded, and outrageously oversized. While most synthetics are heavier than mink lashes, many varieties blend nylon with materials such as silk to lighten the load on natural fringe and provide a softer, more comfortable feel.",Bling Bling Love Lash,"Limited Time Remaining!,200+ viewed today,371 Ratings",Eyelash Extensions at Bling Bling Love Lash (Up to 61% Off),Rutherford,New York,371 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/bling-bling-love-lash-4

Read our guide of the process to prepare for your trip to the salon.,A skilled stylist doesn’t need a pair of scissors to transform a hairdo. The precise application of highlights—which isolate select strands of hair and treat them with a color, lightener, or toner—can become the basis for a brand new look without a single snip or shear. Before entering the salon, however, a client has to decide how much of the hair to highlight. Applied evenly throughout the entire head, full highlights create a natural look that mimics the way hair changes color over time in the sun, adding a sense of dimension and texture to the existing hair. Partial highlights, which are typically cheaper and take less time to apply, serve an altogether different purpose: drawing attention to specific features, such as bangs or newly sharpened antlers, by accenting only the locks on the surface. As a result, partial highlights are somewhat less flexible—losing their effect, for example, when putting your hair up or teasing it out.",NY Elite Hair Salon,"Limited Time Remaining!,60+ viewed today,105 Ratings","Haircut, Style, and Deep Conditioning with Optional Highlights or Color at NY Elite Hair Salon (Up to 62% Off)",Upper East Side,New York,105 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/ny-elite-unisex-hair-salon

"Local,Beauty & Spas,Hair Removal,Bikini Wax","What You'll Get,Choose Between Two Options,$32 for one Brazilian wax ($65 value),$79 for three Brazilian waxes ($195 value),Below the Belt: Choosing Between a Brazilian and a Bikini Wax,The difference between a bikini and Brazilian wax is simple yet significant. Check out our guide to help you choose the right one for you.,Both waxing styles involve using hot wax to remove hair from the area below the waist, but the distinction lies in the degree of hair being removed. During a basic bikini wax, an aesthetician removes hair from any area exposed by a typical bathing suit made of fig leaves. This includes the top and sides of the bikini line as well as the inner thighs, if necessary. The Brazilian wax takes it a step further, removing hair from the entire region, front to back. Since many clients prefer to leave a small, trimmed swath of hair in a strip or triangle just below the panty line, some aestheticians may use the term “full Brazilian” to refer to a session in which no hair is left behind.,Naturally, due to the sensitivity of the areas involved, Brazilians tend to be more painful than basic bikini waxes, and most aestheticians will take care to avoid causing pain during the procedure. There are also several steps you can take to minimize discomfort. Experts recommend avoiding any appointment within a week of menstruation, when the skin is most sensitive, and taking an anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen 30 minutes beforehand can help reduce any swelling that results.",Baire Hair Removal Specialists,"Limited Time Remaining!,20+ viewed today,114 Ratings",One or Three Brazilian Waxes at Baire Hair Removal Specialists (Up to 59% Off),Hell's Kitchen,New York,114 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/baire-hair-removal-specialists

Check out Groupon’s guide to the body’s pliable armor.,If you were to take all your skin and spread it out, it would, on average, cover a twin bed. And though that might be a blessing when you’ve run out of clean sheets, it would leave you defenseless against hazards such as bacteria, chemicals, sunlight, and even water. A complex system of more than 300 million constantly regenerating cells, nerves, and glands, the skin is not only the body’s largest organ, but also its first line of defense against the environment, a flexible, waterproof sheath for all the muscles, bones, and sensitive electronics inside.,In most cases, we can only see the skin’s outer layer, or epidermis, but two more layers lie just below the surface—the dermis, full of flexible collagen and elastin, and a subcutaneous layer of fat meant to cushion and insulate our insides. Of the three layers, the dermis is the workhorse, bracing the capillaries that regulate our body temperature and hosting millions of follicles that knit new hair and expel softening oils. But despite its importance, nobody will ever tell you how nice your dermis looks. Beauty, after all, is only epidermis deep, and it’s there where we see the most change. New skin cells are constantly replacing the old, pushing off roughly 1.5 pounds of dead cells every year, and over time the epidermis slowly loses its ability to retain moisture or spring back into place, resulting in wrinkles, dryness, and other signs of wisdom gained.,One of skin’s most useful attributes is its regenerative ability. When the skin breaks or needs repair, the blood vessels amp into overdrive, carrying much-needed nutrients straight to the site on pallets of platelets. This is why a cut forms a scab and, oddly enough, why our face turns red when we’re sunburned; the color isn’t actually a burn—it’s blood rushing to the face to repair the cellular damage caused by UV rays.",Heena's Threading Salon,"Limited Time Remaining!,20+ viewed today,29 Ratings",One or Two 60-Minute Relaxing Herbal Facials at Heena's Threading Salon (Up to 58% Off),Midtown East,New York,29 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/heena-s-threading-salon-2

"Local,Beauty & Spas,Hair Removal,Waxing","What You'll Get,Choice of:,One Chocolate Brazilian Wax,Three Chocolate Brazilian Waxes,Below the Belt: Choosing Between a Brazilian and a Bikini Wax,The difference between a bikini and Brazilian wax is simple yet significant. Check out our guide to help you choose the right one for you.,Both waxing styles involve using hot wax to remove hair from the area below the waist, but the distinction lies in the degree of hair being removed. During a basic bikini wax, an aesthetician removes hair from any area exposed by a typical bathing suit made of fig leaves. This includes the top and sides of the bikini line as well as the inner thighs, if necessary. The Brazilian wax takes it a step further, removing hair from the entire region, front to back. Since many clients prefer to leave a small, trimmed swath of hair in a strip or triangle just below the panty line, some aestheticians may use the term “full Brazilian” to refer to a session in which no hair is left behind.,Naturally, due to the sensitivity of the areas involved, Brazilians tend to be more painful than basic bikini waxes, and most aestheticians will take care to avoid causing pain during the procedure. There are also several steps you can take to minimize discomfort. Experts recommend avoiding any appointment within a week of menstruation, when the skin is most sensitive, and taking an anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen 30 minutes beforehand can help reduce any swelling that results.",Waxing Center EV,"Limited Time Remaining!,30+ viewed today,33 Ratings",One or Three Chocolate Brazilian Waxes at Waxing Center EV (Up to 59% Off),East Village,New York,33 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/waxing-center-ev

Check out Groupon’s study of the science behind their constant regeneration.,Whether replacing fat cells at the rate of 10% each year or spawning new skin cells by the minute, the human body is in a constant state of regeneration. Besides our hair, nowhere is this continual growth and change more evident than in the nails. Highly vulnerable to chips and snags, fingernails compensate for the abuse by growing approximately 0.1 inch per month, regenerating completely in around four to six months. Toenails, by contrast, grow at a rate about three to four times slower, taking up to 18 months to fully bloom again.,The process begins beneath the skin’s surface just above the first knuckle, at a site known as the nail root, or nail matrix, which produces the tough, transparent keratin protein that makes up each nail. From this subcutaneous factory, the nail crawls across the flat, sensitive portion of skin called the nail bed, continuously growing until it’s either trimmed or gets stuck in a filing-cabinet keyhole. As the nail continues to sprout, the outer tissue on its bottom edge—called the eponychium—and the skin that frames it on the sides—called the folds—hold it in place and protect it against foreign invaders such as dirt, bacteria, and water. Along the way, dead skin cells from the eponychium embed themselves to the nail plate—forming the pale, crescent-shaped layer known as the cuticle, which functions as a sort of dam sealing off the eponychium and further protecting the body from impurities.,In a study attempting to explain why the growing rate of British thumbnails have increased from 3 millimeters (about 0.12 inches) per month in 1938 to 3.55 millimeters (about 0.14 inches) today, researchers at the University of North Carolina proposed this theory: “A rapid change in the environment, lifestyle and health conditions—such as diet, physical activity and body composition—has occurred over the past 30 years.” Indeed, there are a number of variables that determine how fast a nail springs forth. The amount of vitamin D a person receives, for instance, has shown to affect growth, so nails tend to flourish faster in the plentiful sunlight of summer. Age is another factor—children grow their nails at an incredibly fast rate until reaching puberty, at which point their nail growth slows down by 50%. Even right- or left-handedness plays a role, as nails tend to come in more quickly on the dominant hand, which is why volleyball players spike with their opposite hand to avoid popping the ball.",Spa For Life,"Limited Time Remaining!,150+ viewed today,1,008 Ratings","One Mani-Pedi or Three vouchers, Each Good for One Mani-Pedi at Spa for Life (50% Off)",Chinatown,New York,"1,008 Ratings",https://www.groupon.com/deals/spa-for-life

 works because the hair on our body grows differently than the hair on 
our heads. Check out Groupon’s guide to hair growth to learn the science
 behind strands.,Hair varies in thickness and length across our 
body, from the head’s massive jungle to the knuckles’ tiny brambles. But
 regardless of where it is, each strand of hair cycles through three 
phases: anagen, also known as the active growth phase; catagen, or 
transitional phase; and telogen, or resting phase. During the growth 
phase, a new hair shaft sprouts from a follicle as its cells rapidly 
divide and grow upward, forming tightly packed bundles rich with keratin
 protein. Next, the transition phase kicks in for about two to three 
weeks, during which growth stops and the outer root sheath shrinks, 
anchoring the hair to the follicle as it enters the final phase. At that
 point, the follicle lies dormant until the hair is shed and the cycle 
begins again.,Not all hair grows at the same rate. On the scalp,
 hair grows about 6 inches per year, with each strand spending about two
 to six years in the active phase. Meanwhile, hair on the arms, legs, 
eyelids, and eyebrows actively grows for a much shorter period—only 
about 30–45 days—and spends more time in the resting phase, which is why
 waxing these areas helps curb unwanted hair growth. Humans need removal
 methods such as waxing because we don’t shed our hair all at once like 
other mammals; our hair-growth cycles are random and staggered, whereas 
other animals’ cycles are mostly synchronized.",Heena's Threading Salon,"Limited Time Remaining!,Up to 55% Off,29 Ratings",Threading Sessions at Heena's Threading Salon (Up to 55% Off). Four Options Available.,Midtown East,New York,29 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/heena-s-threading-salon-3

####Body Hair: Getting to the Root,Body hair can be unsightly, but it’s all part of a natural process. Read on for a basic overview of this stubborn foe.,Follicle,: the part of the skin that anchors an individual shaft of hair. Each follicle consists of a sebaceous gland, which secretes oil (sebum) to condition the hair and skin, and a few nerve endings at the base that allow hair to carry out one of its main functions: to act as a sensitive touch receptor.,Growth cycles,: during the initial phase of the hair-growth cycle,,anagen,, strands grow up to 0.2 mm per day. This is followed by a,catagen,phase, which lasts two–three weeks, then a,telogen,phase in which hair stops growing. Individual follicles may be at different stages of the cycle at any given time.,Epilation,: the removal of hair from the root. Common methods include tweezing, waxing, laser hair removal, and stapling a tiny eviction notice to every follicle.,Depilation,: the removal of hair from above the skin, usually via shaving or depilation creams, which evolved in the 1930s from formulas used to remove hair from cattle hides.,Jazz bikinis,: the common term for the short skirts worn by flappers in the 1920s—a trend often attributed to the rise of leg shaving as a popular routine.",Unique Threading Salon,"Limited Time Remaining!,30+ viewed today,16 Ratings",Brazilian or Eyebrow Wax or Eyebrow Threading at Unique Threading Salon (Up to 51% Off),Midtown Manhattan,New York,16 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/unique-threading-salon-1-3

Prepare to give it a spin by reading Groupon’s brief introduction.,If certain members of the International Pole Dance Fitness Association have their way and pole dancing becomes an official Olympic sport, it won’t be without good reason. The pastime employs the same level of stamina, coordination, and flexibility found in other notable Olympic disciplines. As a combination of gymnastic movements and dance, pole fitness acts as both an anaerobic and aerobic workout: proficient dancers twist, climb, and glissade around poles, supporting and controlling their own body weight with a seemingly effortless grace. The men and women who practice pole dancing on a regular basis often report improvement not just in strength, but also self-confidence and body image.,Although once pegged as a controversial erotic performance art, pole dancing has rapidly blossomed into an internationally respected form of fitness, boasting more than 500 studios in the United States alone.

Check out our guide to help you choose the right one for you.,Both waxing styles involve using hot wax to remove hair from the area below the waist, but the distinction lies in the degree of hair being removed. During a basic bikini wax, an aesthetician removes hair from any area exposed by a typical bathing suit made of fig leaves. This includes the top and sides of the bikini line as well as the inner thighs, if necessary. The Brazilian wax takes it a step further, removing hair from the entire region, front to back. Since many clients prefer to leave a small, trimmed swath of hair in a strip or triangle just below the panty line, some aestheticians may use the term “full Brazilian” to refer to a session in which no hair is left behind.,Naturally, due to the sensitivity of the areas involved, Brazilians tend to be more painful than basic bikini waxes, and most aestheticians will take care to avoid causing pain during the procedure. There are also several steps you can take to minimize discomfort. Experts recommend avoiding any appointment within a week of menstruation, when the skin is most sensitive, and taking an anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen 30 minutes beforehand can help reduce any swelling that results.",Blossom Brows Threading Salon,"Limited Time Remaining!,40+ viewed today,370 Ratings",One or Two Brazilian Waxes at Blossom Brows Threading Salon (Up to 51% Off),Upper East Side,New York,370 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/blossom-brows-threading-salon

Kickboxing is many disciplines in one, incorporating moves and techniques from many martial arts.,Punches, kicks, elbows, clinches, and takedowns are all fair game. As such, styles can vary widely among martial-arts purists, boxers, and fighters who work to cultivate a unique approach.,2. Its versatility translates well to fitness.,Kickboxing balances upper- and lower-body flexibility with cardiovascular exercise, making for an effective full-body workout. Practitioners also get the benefit of learning self-defense techniques, getting a leg up on their peers who only know how to chuck a treadmill at an attacker.,3. It’s not that old.,Kickboxing is quite popular in Thailand, which is also home to Muay Thai—a form of boxing, practiced as a regulated sport since the late 19th century, in which fighters don gloves and other pads. In 1966, a Japanese karate promoter became infatuated with Muay Thai—and particularly the full-contact striking that’s not allowed in karate—and saw an opportunity to blend the styles. He prepared three karate fighters to take on Muay Thai specialists, and the competition was fierce enough to inspire the birth, a few years later, of kickboxing as an organized sport.",CKO Kickboxing Gramercy,"Limited Time Remaining!,100+ viewed today,103 Ratings",Three or Six Kickboxing Classes at CKO Kickboxing Gramercy (Up to 79%  Off),Midtown Manhattan,New York,103 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/cko-kickboxing-gramercy

Read on to learn the philosophy and history behind those shrinking letters.,According to the,Seattle Times,, the best-selling poster in the United States isn’t of Indiana Jones or the cover to Pink Floyd’s,Generic World Map,. It’s the eye chart, those iconic rows of decreasingly sized letters that grace optometrists’ offices throughout the country. Aesthetics aside, the ubiquitous chart primarily tests visual acuity, which the,American Optometric Association,summarizes as “the clarity or sharpness of vision.” Patients typically stand around 20 feet from the wall, cover one eye, and identify the smallest row of letters they can individually distinguish. Commonly, this boils patients’ visual acuities down to a fraction in which the denominator represents how many feet away a person of normal visual acuity could stand while still discerning the letters with the same level of clarity as the patient. In other words, 20/40 vision means the patient needs to stand 20 feet away to make out the same size letters as a person with standard vision can from 40 feet.,These fractions were the brainchild of Herman Snellen, a Dutch ophthalmologist who designed the first popular rendition of an eye chart in the 1860s. The original versions of Snellen’s chart included nine letters—C, D, E, F, L, O, P, T, and Z—as,optotypes,—a term for standardized symbols used to test vision. However, there was room for improvement in Snellen’s design; the spacing wasn’t quite standardized, and different versions incorporated serif as well as sans serif fonts. Over the years, the Snellen chart has adopted more uniform spacing and cleaner optotypes, and a few alternatives have sprung up for use in other settings. For instance, scientists prefer a chart designed by two Australian optometrists for its logarithmic progression of letter size, and one variation simply orients the single letter ‘E’ in different directions, making the test easier for patients who are illiterate or unfamiliar with the Roman alphabet.,For all their value, eye charts are still only capable of assessing visual acuity, not vision in general. Full eye exams almost invariably include a staring contest with an eye chart, but optometrists also use different tools to test everything from peripheral awareness and depth perception to focusing ability and color vision.",Cohen's Fashion Optical,"Limited Time Remaining!,50+ viewed today,41 Ratings",Eye Exam with $385 Credit Towards Complete Designer Frames with Lenses (92% Off),Cohen's Fashion Optical,New York,41 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/cohen-s-fashion-optical-660-lexington-ave-1

Check out Groupon's guide to hair growth to learn the science behind strands.,Hair varies in thickness and length across our body, from the head's massive jungle to the knuckles' tiny brambles. But regardless of where it is, each strand of hair cycles through three phases: anagen, also known as the active growth phase; catagen, or transitional phase; and telogen, or resting phase. During the growth phase, a new hair shaft sprouts from a follicle as its cells rapidly divide and grow upward, forming tightly packed bundles rich with keratin protein. Next, the transition phase kicks in for about two to three weeks, during which growth stops and the outer root sheath shrinks, anchoring the hair to the follicle as it enters the final phase. At that point, the follicle lies dormant until the hair is shed and the cycle begins again.,Not all hair grows at the same rate. On the scalp, hair grows about 6 inches per year, with each strand spending about two to six years in the active phase. Meanwhile, hair on the arms, legs, eyelids, and eyebrows actively grows for a much shorter period—only about 30–45 days—and spends more time in the resting phase, which is why waxing these areas helps curb unwanted hair growth. Humans need removal methods such as waxing because we don't shed our hair all at once like other mammals; our hair-growth cycles are random and staggered, whereas other animals' cycles are mostly synchronized.",Organic Element Spa NY,"Limited Time Remaining!,60+ viewed today,1,534 Ratings",One or Three Brazilian Waxes at Organic Element Spa NY (Up to 64% Off),Midtown Manhattan,New York,"1,534 Ratings",https://www.groupon.com/deals/organic-element-spa-ny-1

"Local,Health & Fitness,Natural Medicine,Acupuncture","What You'll Get,The Deal,$36 for an acupuncture assessment and treatment ($250 value),Acupuncture Meridians: Mapping the Body Electric,In choosing which points to stimulate, your acupuncturist will be guided by a network of meridians running through the body. Begin to navigate these pathways with Groupon’s exploration of acupuncture meridians.,Like currents in the air, acupuncture meridians—as postulated by traditional Chinese medicine—are invisible paths of action in the body. Acupuncture theory holds that a person’s life force, or chi, flows along specific channels from organ to organ. When chi becomes unbalanced or blocked, health and wellness problems arise, such as digestive trouble or a bicep that looks like a creepy face when you flex. It’s the acupuncturist’s job to unblock chi by inserting thin needles into carefully chosen points along these pathways.,Twelve primary meridians flow through the body, each categorized as yin or yang (roughly defined as the passive and active forces within nature). Each meridian corresponds to a specific organ, element, and set of emotions. For instance, the lung meridian flows through the arm and is associated with yin and metal; should its flow of energy be disturbed, feelings of grief and sadness may manifest. For each condition an acupuncturist seeks to assuage, a timetable dictates when each meridian is most active and therefore easiest to treat. With so many complexities to keep in mind, it’s easy to understand why acupuncturists must undertake thousands of hours of coursework to become licensed.,So far, doctors and scientists have had little luck mapping meridians to visible anatomical structures, but some studies have uncovered overlap between ancient and modern medicine. For example, meridians tend to fall along planes between muscles, or between a muscle and bone or tendon—areas usually rich with connective tissue. A 2010,study,published in,PLOS One,made one further connection: bands of collagenous tissue, in particular, present less opposition to the flow of electricity than other areas of the body. These bands underlie some—though not all—primary meridians, suggesting that the energy known as chi may be related in some way to the energy that zips through our power lines and singing toothbrushes.",Columbus Circle Acupuncture Wellness,"Limited Time Remaining!,30+ viewed today,164 Ratings",$36 for an Acupuncture Assessment and Treatment at Columbus Circle Acupuncture Wellness ($250 Value),Columbus Circle Acupuncture Wellness,New York,164 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/bravo-texas-acupuncture-wellness-1

Learn what holds your california roll together with Groupon’s guide to this sensational seaweed.,Sushi is common enough today that most people recognize nori, the dark-green or purple seaweed paper that encases each roll’s ingredients. Not only does nori keep sushi from falling apart, it adds a dose of vitamins and minerals including calcium, iron, and potassium to each bite.,In the past, farmers simply plucked naturally grown algae from the sea, cleaned off all the mermaid hairs, and dried it into nori. Today, its life cycle begins in a building that may resemble a swimming pool or bathhouse at first glance: a big, sunny seedling center lined with wide, shallow tanks of seawater. Each tank is lined with oyster shells, which act as mineral-rich food for Porphyra spores. After they’ve been feeding and growing for about five months, it’s time to seed the nets. Rotating drums are wound with synthetic nets, then spun through the tanks for 20–60 minutes to become saturated with spores.,At that point, the operation moves to the sea, where the nets are attached to bamboo poles to continue their life and grow into long, ragged pennants amid the tides. Once harvested, the plants are washed, ground into a pulp, and flattened into sheets. Finally, the sheets are toasted, graded, and readied for consumption, either as the partly rehydrated casing around sushi rolls or by themselves for a snack as healthy and crunchy as toasted Flintstones vitamins.",Kikoo Sushi,"Limited Time Remaining!,550+ viewed today,3,827 Ratings","Two Hours of All-You-Can-Eat Sushi, Sashimi & Teriyaki Dinner with Drinks at Kikoo Sushi (Up to 53% Off)",New York,New York,"3,827 Ratings",https://www.groupon.com/deals/kikoo-sushi

Feed your need for knowledge with Groupon’s study of food cravings.,For years, scientists believed that food cravings were linked to nutrient deficiencies—a taste for steak might signify a lack of iron, for instance. But recent research has uncovered a different theory. A functional MRI study cited by the,Wall Street Journal,suggested that food cravings are more similar to an addiction, triggered by reward centers in the brain that relate to memory and emotion. Answering to the craving can trigger the release of neurotransmitters including endorphins (which produce feelings of well-being) and dopamine (which produces the sense of receiving a reward), explaining why we turn to less-than-wholesome “comfort” foods in times of stress.,Nutritionists would love it if we only craved broccoli seasoned with calcium chews, but the reality is that most hankerings tend toward the unhealthy. A survey of college students at an Ontario university found that 97% of women experienced occasional intense cravings, often for carb-loaded foods such as chocolate, donuts, and chips. In the same survey, 68% of men also reported food cravings, though usually for high-fat proteins such as burgers, steaks, and pizza. As you might expect from the “comfort” theory of food cravings, the results of such surveys change drastically depending on the culture.,Although humans may not normally crave foods based on nutritional need, it is true that weightlifters seem to actively crave muscle-building carbs and proteins such as potatoes and pasta. That’s because the body can adjust its cravings to be able to perform everyday activities more efficiently. Sports scientist Dr. David Stensel and his colleagues found that runners crave hydrating fruits and cold-water swimmers crave fatty foods that will provide protective padding, just as professional Scrabble players crave alphabet soup.",Avenue Diner,"Limited Time Remaining!,70+ viewed today,201 Ratings","Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner at Avenue Diner (Up to 50% Off).

"Local,Beauty & Spas,Hair Removal,Bikini Wax","What You'll Get,Choice of:,One Chocolate Brazilian Wax,One Cream Brazilian Wax,Three Chocolate Brazilian Waxes,Below the Belt: Choosing Between a Brazilian and a Bikini Wax,The difference between a bikini and Brazilian wax is simple yet significant. Check out our guide to help you choose the right one for you.,Both waxing styles involve using hot wax to remove hair from the area below the waist, but the distinction lies in the degree of hair being removed. During a basic bikini wax, an aesthetician removes hair from any area exposed by a typical bathing suit made of fig leaves. This includes the top and sides of the bikini line as well as the inner thighs, if necessary. The Brazilian wax takes it a step further, removing hair from the entire region, front to back. Since many clients prefer to leave a small, trimmed swath of hair in a strip or triangle just below the panty line, some aestheticians may use the term “full Brazilian” to refer to a session in which no hair is left behind.,Naturally, due to the sensitivity of the areas involved, Brazilians tend to be more painful than basic bikini waxes, and most aestheticians will take care to avoid causing pain during the procedure. There are also several steps you can take to minimize discomfort. Experts recommend avoiding any appointment within a week of menstruation, when the skin is most sensitive, and taking an anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen 30 minutes beforehand can help reduce any swelling that results.",The Waxing Factory,"Limited Time Remaining!,100+ viewed today,124 Ratings","One Cream Brazilian Wax, or One or Three Chocolate Brazilian Waxes at The Waxing Factory (Up to 54% Off)",Upper East Side,New York,124 Ratings,https://www.groupon.com/deals/the-waxing-factory-3
